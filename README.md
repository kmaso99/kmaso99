**Data Analyst / Data Scientist** working across **ecological, financial, and aerospace** datasets.

I build clean, reproducible analysis pipelines end-to-end — **data → features → evaluation → packaging** — with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and decision-ready outputs.

---

## What I do
- Turn messy real-world data into clean, structured datasets
- Build reproducible research workflows and modeling pipelines
- Design leakage-free experiment structures and evaluation splits
- Communicate results clearly through plots, maps, and short technical writeups

## What I specialize in

- Environmental + ecological data analysis
- Geospatial and spatiotemporal reasoning
- Data validation + quality checks
- Clear, defensible methodology
- Communicating results through accessible visuals and short technical narratives

## 🧪 Featured projects

**📈 [Quanta Multi‑Signal Equity Strategy (Flagship)](https://github.com/kmaso99/quanta-multi-signal-equity-strategy)**
50-signal systematic equity strategy with disciplined **TRAIN → VALIDATION → LOCKED → HOLDOUT** workflow.

*Signals: experiment rigor, leakage controls, reproducibility.*

**🌱 Environmental + Biodata Analyses**
- [Environmental data](https://github.com/kmaso99/environmental-data)
- [Data visualizations](https://github.com/kmaso99/data-visualizations)
   
*Signals: geospatial reasoning, environmental modeling, communication.*

**✈️ [Aerospace + Security Data Analyses](https://github.com/kmaso99/aerospace-data)**
Notebooks transforming raw aerospace/security datasets into interpretable insights.

*Signals: data cleaning, feature engineering, visual clarity.*

## 🛠️ Stack
`Python` `SQL` `R` `pandas` `scikit-learn` `Jupyter` `matplotlib/plotly` `geospatial tooling`

---

## How I work
Reproducible by default: clean repo structure, documented assumptions, deterministic evaluation splits.

I bias toward clarity, metrics, and methodological discipline over flashy modeling.
